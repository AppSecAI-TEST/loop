Constraints

- All free variables must be resolvable to the set of known types
- The set of known types consists of:
  - All primitive types bundled with loop
  - All user defined abstract types
  - All user defined concrete types
- Two types are convertible if all their members are convertible
- Two functions are convertible if their signatures match
  - If An = Bn where n is the number of arguments
  - If A1t = B1t where A1t is the type of the first argument of A and so on
  - if At = Bt, i.e. if the return types are convertible

To be done
----------

Parsing Classes
- class declaration
- function declaration in class
- enumeration type
- class constants?

- Type analyzer

Stretch
-------

- 'where' scoping
- Pattern matching methods
- guards for pattern matching methods
- Type classes (better than interfaces/traits)
- Optimizer
- Interactive interpreter/shell
- Calling into Java methods
- immutables?
- Parsing require decl hiding (stuff)
